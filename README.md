# htreadings-aws

## Prerequesites
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Terraform installed

## Install AWS infrastructure

Get the python requirements for all Lambda functions in `/code/lambda`

 ```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --target .
```

 ```bash
cd ../../../terraform
```

 ```bash
terraform init
```

 ```bash
terraform plan
```

 ```bash
terraform apply
```

Execute the init-db lambda function in AWS to create the htreadings table.

Running `terraform apply` will create the ElasticBeanstalk environment, application and application version for our deployment file but it will not actually deploy the application. For this we need to use the aws cli to update the environmentâ€™s application version.
 ```bash
aws --region $REGION elasticbeanstalk update-environment --environment-name $(terraform output env_name) --version-label $(terraform output app_version)
```
